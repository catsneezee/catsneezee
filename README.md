Introduction
Hello, my name is Youngkwang Choi, a master's student at Sungkyunkwan University.

I am interested in computer vision technology, where computers can replace human vision.

I am fascinated by the possibilities that computer vision can be applied to various fields such as autonomous driving and robotics.

In the future, my goal is to research deep learning-based computer vision systems and become a developer working in various fields.
